		<p>Once you have downloaded the main zip file called &quot;springchic.zip&quot; and unzipped it, you will see a see more files. These include this documentation, fonts and website assets and graphics. Your theme file is the zip file called &quot;springchic.zip&quot; Go to your wordpress admin panel to &quot;appearance&quot; &gt; &quot;themes&quot;. You will see a tab at the top called &quot;install themes&quot;. Click on that and then use the upload option to upload the zip file called &quot;springchic.zip&quot; Once that has uploaded you will click &quot;activate&quot; and you are good to go!</p>

		<h3 id="gravatar"><strong>C) Uploading your logo and other site options</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>Once you have installed this theme, you will notice under the theme description there is a link to &quot;customize&quot;. If you click on this link a page opens up that allows you to change some of the site options. Your logo gets uploaded here. So you can upload that under &quot;site tag and title&quot;. There are also some other options on this page, so you can customize some of your own colors. Please note that if you want further color customizations you will need to purchase those extra. This theme was purchased as this design, so some options are irrelevant as they have been replaced with background images, etc. You are welcome to edit the css of this theme to do your own modifications, but if you are unsure of what you are doing please be careful as I cannot be responsible for a broken theme.</p>

		<h3 id="logo"><strong>D) Some wordpress settings and theme dimensions</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>This theme comes with a few different layouts. Full width, sidebar right, sidebar left, and front page + sidebar.	Full	width: 1200px Content with sidebar is 770px for the content area and 300px for the sidebar area, so keep these things in mind when creating your images. I would suggest going to the media settings in wordpress and changing the medium size image to be no wider than 770px if you are going to be using a sidebar and change the largest image to 1200px instead of 1024px so your images will be full width if you are not going to size them before uploading them. Changing you thumbnail image size to 250px is also suggested so 4 images fit nicely across a full width page or fill a page if you use the &quot;insert gallery&quot; option.</p>
		<p>Menu - This theme supports custom menus. Those can be found under &quot;appearance&quot; &gt; &quot;menus&quot;</p>
	  <p>Footer - Your footer content will be the copyright year and whatever you put in for the name of your site in the site settings.</p>
		<p>Want to make it look like the demo site? Unzip the samplecontent.zip file and you can import the xml file so you will have the same images and menu as the demo.</p>

		<h3 id="topmenu"><strong>E) Widgets</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>When you download the files for this theme, you will also want to install this plugin from your dashboard, under &quot;plugins&quot;</p>
		<p>http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wysiwyg-widgets/</p>
	  <p>We will be using it in this theme to allow you to easily create your own sidebar with your graphics, social links and images etc. You will find all documentation for using this plugin on the plugin website: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wysiwyg-widgets/</p>
		<p>If you are unsure how to install a plugin, you can learn more here: http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/		</p>
<hr>
	
		<h3 id="footermenu"><strong>F) Graphics and Images</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>Located in your package you will find a folder called &quot;assets&quot;. This folder<span class="uline"></span>	contains	the photoshop files so you can easily modify some of the key graphics on the site, including the social icons, bio picture and gallery images. These files should be saved as a png file if your site background is not white. The custom font used in this site and on the social icons is called &quot;some weatz&quot; and can be found and downloaded here: <a href="http://www.dafont.com/some-weatz.font">http://www.dafont.com/some-weatz.font</a></p>
<hr>
	
		<h3 id="exclude"><strong>G) Page Templates</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>When you create or edit a page in your dashboard you will see an option for &quot;Template&quot; located in the page attributes section below the publish options. This is where you choose if you want a page with a sidebar or a full width page. If you want to have a static homepage you will also need to go to your &quot;settings&quot; &gt; &quot;reading&quot; in your dashboard and choose which page to make your static homepage and which page to display your blog posts on.</p>
